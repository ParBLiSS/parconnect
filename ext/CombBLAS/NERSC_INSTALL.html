Combinatorial BLAS compilation instructions for <a href="http://www.nersc.gov/">NERSC</a> resources.
<br><br>
1- First and foremost, make cmake active by running: <em> module load cmake </em> <br>
2- In your CombBLAS_xx directory, rename CMakeLists_NERSC.txt to CMakeLists.txt, replacing the existing one. <br>
3- (On Hopper only) Change the compiler to GNU, using the following command: 
<em> module swap PrgEnv-pgi PrgEnv-gnu </em> <br><br>

Now run <em>"cmake ."</em> , followed by <em>"make"</em> <br> <br>
<br><br>
For tests, you might want to run them through the interactive batch system via <br>
> "qsub -I -V -q debug -l mppwidth=48" <br>
> "cd $PBS_O_WORKDIR" <br>
> "ctest -V"
