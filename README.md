==========

### Planned

- Implementation of parallel algorithm for computing connectivity on large graphs.
- Targeted for distributed parallel system.
- Include implementation of Vishkin's PRAM algorithm for connectivity 
- Design algorithm to compute connected components in undirected graphs and SCCs in directed graphs. 
- Algorithm should be a mix of BFS and coloring approach.
- Algorithm should perform best on different graph topologies and not just scale-free graphs.
- Compare against boost connectivity algorithm, parallel BFS, coloring.
